                    <b>Breaking Down Language Barriers: Using AI and NLP to Automate Dubbing Process for Improved Accessibility and Inclusivity</b><br>
                    <br> The project was to develop an AI-powered dubbing app that automatically dubs videos in different languages. The app could detect speech in the original video and generate synchronized dubbing in the desired language using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. As the traditional dubbing methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often require a large team of professionals. The AI Dubbing App aims to provide an innovative solution that can streamline the dubbing process and make it more accessible and affordable. It can cater to diverse applications, such as entertainment, education, documentaries, webinars, conferences, language learning, tourism, business, news, social media, and accessibility for blind people.<br>
                    <br><b>The Project Goals:</b><br>
                    -Develop an AI-powered dubbing app that can detect speech in the original video and generate synchronized dubbing in the desired language.<br>
                    -Improve the accuracy and quality of the dubbing process using state-of-the-art machine learning and NLP techniques.<br>
                    -Provide an innovative and affordable solution for content creators and language learners.<br>
                    -Promote inclusivity and accessibility by designing the AI-powered dubbing application to cater to the needs of diverse users, including individuals with visual impairments and non-native speakers.<br>
                    -Contribute to the advancement of machine learning and NLP techniques by sharing the project's findings, challenges, and successes with the broader scientific and research communities.<br>

                    <br> <b>Learning outcomes: </b><br> -Learned machine learning and NLP techniques, including speech recognition, language translation, and text-to-speech synthesis.<br>
                    -Gained practical experience in designing and implementing AI solutions addressing real-world issues in entertainment, education, and other industries.<br>
                    -Enhanced collaboration, problem-solving, and creativity skills through team-based project development.<br>
